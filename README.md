# Jose's Knowledge Vault

**Jose's Knowledge Vault** is a personal knowledge repository where I collect, organize, and connect information across multiple domains: statistics, machine learning, programming, academic research, and professional development.  

This vault functions as my **digital second brain**, designed to centralize learning, enable quick reference, and support both academic and professional projects.
