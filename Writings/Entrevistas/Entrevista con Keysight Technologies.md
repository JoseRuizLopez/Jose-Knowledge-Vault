# Entrevista con Keysight Technologies

### Can you tell me a bit about yourself and why you’re interested in this role at Keysight?
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Granada. I’ve been working as a Data Scientist at EDUCA EDTECH Group, where I’ve developed and deployed machine learning models— as fine‑tuning large language models. I’m passionate about applying AI to solve real-world problems, and I’m particularly excited about the opportunity at Keysight because of its reputation for innovation and its commitment to advancing technology in various industries. I see this role as the perfect match to leverage my technical skills and also contribute to strategic marketing initiatives on a global scale.

### Share your work experience in your past companies
I have built my expertise through two key roles at EDUCA EDTECH Group. In my current role as a Data Scientist, I lead projects that integrate machine learning and NLP to optimize content creation and retrieval. For example, I developed generative AI processes using **ChatGPT**/**Gemini** to **automate content generation** and **fine-tuned models** like **Llama** on [[Google Cloud]], which significantly reduced costs and improved efficiency. Additionally, I implemented an **NLP-based search process** using [[ElasticSearch]] to enhance content retrieval and standardized our NLP processes across the organization. I also conducted research on [[RAG]] techniques and developed an AI SEO Content Assistant that provided high‑ranking keyword recommendations using data from [[SemRush]], [[Screaming Frog]] and [[Google Search Console]].

Previously, during my internship as a Data Scientist, I focused on laying a solid foundation in data engineering and analytics. I developed and maintained [[ElasticSearch]] indices and web crawling functionalities, designed and implemented FastAPIs in Python, and built ETL pipelines using **BigQuery** to manage and transform data from Akamai. This role allowed me to gain hands-on experience with agile methodologies and cross-functional collaboration.


### Your resume shows strong experience in machine learning and data analytics. Could you describe one project where you built or tuned a machine learning model, including the challenges you faced and how you overcame them?
One project I’m proud of involved fine‑tuning the Llama model to improve automatic content generation for our marketing team. The primary challenge was to reduce costs while ensuring that the model produced high‑quality, relevant content. To address this, I implemented [[Cross Validation]] and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and iteratively optimized [[hiperparámetros|hyperparameters]]. Deploying the model on [[Google Cloud]] allowed us to scale efficiently and monitor performance in real time. Ultimately, the project resulted in significant cost reductions and improved content relevance, which positively impacted our marketing metrics.


### Keysight values the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical team members. Can you share an example of how you’ve communicated complex data insights or ML concepts to a broader audience?
In a recent project, I developed an NLP‑based search system using [[ElasticSearch]] to improve the retrieval of similar blog posts. Although the underlying technology involved complex concepts like vector embeddings and indexing, I created a simple visual dashboard and used everyday analogies—comparing the system to how a search engine finds related articles. I then hosted a workshop with colleagues from marketing and content teams to walk them through the process, focusing on the business benefits and practical outcomes rather than technical details. This approach not only helped them understand the system but also built trust in the tool’s reliability.


### Given that the role involves working with multiple data sources and ensuring data quality, how do you approach data integration and what steps do you take to ensure accuracy?

I start by mapping all the data sources to understand the data flow and identify any potential gaps or inconsistencies. My approach involves building robust ETL pipelines using Python and SQL—processes I developed at EDUCA EDTECH Group for managing data in BigQuery. I incorporate rigorous data cleaning and validation steps, such as setting up automated checks to catch anomalies and employing statistical methods to detect outliers. This systematic process not only ensures that the integrated data is accurate but also lays the groundwork for building reliable machine learning models.


### Remote collaboration is a key part of this role. Can you describe a time when you successfully managed a project or communicated within a fully remote team?

In my current position, I managed a project that involved members of the company, some of whom were in the office and some of whom were working from home. We utilized agile methodologies and collaborative tools like Microsoft Teams, Jira, and Confluence. We had regular virtual meetings and clear communication channels to ensure everyone was on the same page regarding deadlines and deliverables. By setting up structured updates and using shared dashboards to track progress, we managed to complete our generative AI content project ahead of schedule. This experience has honed my skills in remote working and effective digital communication.


### Marketing data can sometimes be ambiguous or incomplete. How do you prioritize or fill in data gaps to build reliable models or reports?

When dealing with ambiguous or incomplete marketing data, I begin with a thorough exploratory data analysis to understand where the gaps are and their potential impact. I prioritize critical data points by evaluating their importance to the model’s performance. In cases where data is missing, I employ statistical imputation techniques and sometimes integrate external data sources to fill those gaps. Moreover, I work closely with the teams responsible for data collection to improve the overall process, ensuring that future data is more complete and accurate. This balanced approach allows me to build models and reports that are both reliable and actionable.


### What interests you the most about Keysight’s mission and culture, and how do you see yourself contributing to the team’s success?
I’m really drawn to Keysight’s commitment to innovation and its broad impact across industries such as 5G, automotive, and aerospace. The company’s focus on ethical practices, diversity, and continuous improvement resonates with my personal values. I see myself contributing by leveraging my expertise in machine learning and data analytics to optimize marketing strategies. My background in developing scalable AI solutions and working with diverse, remote teams makes me confident that I can help drive data-driven insights that support Keysight’s strategic goals. I’m eager to collaborate with the team and bring fresh ideas to further enhance the marketing pipeline.


### Do you have any questions for us about the role, the team, or Keysight’s strategic direction?
Yes, I do. Could you share more about how the marketing data team collaborates with other departments to drive business strategy? I’m also interested in learning how Keysight plans to evolve its BI and analytics capabilities in the coming years, particularly with emerging AI technologies. Finally, what does success look like for someone in this role during the first six to twelve months?
