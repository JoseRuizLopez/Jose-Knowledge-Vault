# Entrevista con Hypatos
### AI Prompting Engineer at Hypatos

#### Can you start by telling us a little about yourself and your background in AI and NLP?
Sure! My name is José Ruiz López, and I’m passionate about artificial intelligence and its real-world applications. I have been working as a Data Scientist at EDUCA EDTECH Group, where I have focused on Generative AI, NLP, and machine learning projects. I have experience in prompt engineering, fine-tuning large language models like LLaMA, and developing AI-driven content generation tools. I also have a strong foundation in search and retrieval systems, using technologies like [[ElasticSearch]] and [[Pinecone]] for indexing and similarity detection.

#### This role requires designing and optimizing prompts for LLMs. Can you describe your experience with prompt engineering and how you've optimized AI-generated outputs?
Absolutely! In my current role, I have developed and optimized prompts for Generative AI tools like [[ChatGPT]] and Gemini. For instance, I worked on refining prompts for automatic content generation by leveraging chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting techniques. Additionally, I fine-tuned a LLaMA model to create a localized AI system, optimizing its outputs for specific tasks while reducing cloud processing costs. I also explored [[RAG]] techniques to improve accuracy and contextual relevance.

#### We’re also interested in your experience with LLM performance evaluation. How have you measured and improved model performance in your previous projects?
I have evaluated LLMs using metrics such as perplexity, [[BLEU]] scores, and [[Métricas de Similitud|cosine similarity]] for text-based tasks. In one project, I implemented a system using [[ElasticSearch]] to measure content similarity and improve AI-generated results. Additionally, I worked with [[RAG]] models to enhance response quality by integrating external data sources, ensuring more accurate and fact-based outputs.

#### Our team works with AI agents and frameworks like [[LangChain]]. Do you have experience with such technologies?

Yes! I have used [[LangChain]] to develop AI-driven solutions, particularly for intelligent document processing and retrieval tasks. I implemented [[LangGraph]] for structured workflows in AI pipelines, ensuring that generated responses were more aligned with business needs. Additionally, I have worked on integrating APIs for efficient deployment of NLP models.

#### We value collaboration and problem-solving. Can you share an example of a challenge you faced and how you solved it?
Sure! One challenge I faced was optimizing the retrieval process for content similarity detection. Initially, our system struggled with ranking relevant content effectively. To address this, I integrated a hybrid search approach combining keyword-based retrieval with semantic search using word embeddings. This significantly improved content ranking accuracy and user experience.

#### Why are you interested in joining Hypatos, and how do you see yourself contributing to our team?
I’m excited about Hypatos because of its focus on AI-driven automation and document processing. My experience with LLMs, [[NLP search techniques]], and fine-tuning models aligns well with the role. I believe I can contribute by optimizing AI agents for intelligent document understanding, improving retrieval methods, and ensuring model efficiency through advanced prompt engineering techniques.

#### Do you have any questions for us?
Yes! Could you tell me more about the challenges your AI Delivery team is currently facing and how you see the role of prompt engineering evolving in your company?
