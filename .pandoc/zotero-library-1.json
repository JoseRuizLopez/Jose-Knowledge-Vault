  {"id":"albelwiFrameworkDesigningArchitectures2017","abstract":"Recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have obtained promising results in difficult deep learning tasks. However, the success of a CNN depends on finding an architecture to fit a given problem. A hand-crafted architecture is a challenging, time-consuming process that requires expert knowledge and effort, due to a large number of architectural design choices. In this article, we present an efficient framework that automatically designs a high-performing CNN architecture for a given problem. In this framework, we introduce a new optimization objective function that combines the error rate and the information learnt by a set of feature maps using deconvolutional networks (deconvnet). The new objective function allows the hyperparameters of the CNN architecture to be optimized in a way that enhances the performance by guiding the CNN through better visualization of learnt features via deconvnet. The actual optimization of the objective function is carried out via the Nelder-Mead Method (NMM). Further, our new objective function results in much faster convergence towards a better architecture. The proposed framework has the ability to explore a CNN architecture’s numerous design choices in an efficient way and also allows effective, distributed execution and synchronization via web services. Empirically, we demonstrate that the CNN architecture designed with our approach outperforms several existing approaches in terms of its error rate. Our results are also competitive with state-of-the-art results on the MNIST dataset and perform reasonably against the state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our approach has a significant role in increasing the depth, reducing the size of strides, and constraining some convolutional layers not followed by pooling layers in order to find a CNN architecture that produces a high recognition performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Albelwi","given":"Saleh"},{"family":"Mahmood","given":"Ausif"}],"citation-key":"albelwiFrameworkDesigningArchitectures2017","container-title":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e19060242","ISSN":"1099-4300","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"6","page":"242","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Framework for Designing the Architectures of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/19/6/242","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"alnuaimHumanComputerInteractionHand2022","abstract":"Sign language is the native language of deaf people, which they use in their daily life, and it facilitates the communication process between deaf people. The problem faced by deaf people is targeted using sign language technique. Sign language refers to the use of the arms and hands to communicate, particularly among those who are deaf. This varies depending on the person and the location from which they come. As a result, there is no standardization about the sign language to be used; for example, American, British, Chinese, and Arab sign languages are all distinct. Here, in this study we trained a model, which will be able to classify the Arabic sign language, which consists of 32 Arabic alphabet sign classes. In images, sign language is detected through the pose of the hand. In this study, we proposed a framework, which consists of two CNN models, and each of them is individually trained on the training set. The final predictions of the two models were ensembled to achieve higher results. The dataset used in this study is released in 2019 and is called as ArSL2018. It is launched at the Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University, Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia. The main contribution in this study is resizing the images to 64 ∗ 64 pixels, converting from grayscale images to three-channel images, and then applying the median filter to the images, which acts as lowpass filtering in order to smooth the images and reduce noise and to make the model more robust to avoid overfitting. Then, the preprocessed image is fed into two different models, which are ResNet50 and MobileNetV2. ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 architectures were implemented together. The results we achieved on the test set for the whole data are with an accuracy of about 97% after applying many preprocessing techniques and different hyperparameters for each model, and also different data augmentation techniques.","author":[{"family":"Alnuaim","given":"Abeer"},{"family":"Zakariah","given":"Mohammed"},{"family":"Hatamleh","given":"Wesam Atef"},{"family":"Tarazi","given":"Hussam"},{"family":"Tripathi","given":"Vikas"},{"family":"Amoatey","given":"Enoch Tetteh"}],"citation-key":"alnuaimHumanComputerInteractionHand2022","container-title":"Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1155/2022/8777355","ISSN":"1687-5273","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"8777355","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Human-Computer Interaction with Hand Gesture Recognition Using ResNet and MobileNet","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1155/2022/8777355","volume":"2022"},
  {"id":"arazziSecureFederatedData2025","abstract":"Dataset Distillation (DD) is a powerful technique for reducing large datasets into compact, representative synthetic datasets, accelerating Machine Learning training. However, traditional DD methods operate in a centralized manner, which poses significant privacy threats and reduces its applicability. To mitigate these risks, we propose a Secure Federated Data Distillation (SFDD) framework to decentralize the distillation process while preserving privacy. Unlike existing Federated Distillation techniques that focus on training global models with distilled knowledge, our approach aims to produce a distilled dataset without exposing local contributions. We leverage the gradient-matching-based distillation method, adapting it for a distributed setting where clients contribute to the distillation process without sharing raw data. The central aggregator iteratively refines a synthetic dataset by integrating client-side updates while ensuring data confidentiality. To make our approach resilient to inference attacks perpetrated by the server that could exploit gradient updates to reconstruct private data, we create an optimized Local Differential Privacy approach, called LDPO-RLD. Furthermore, we assess the framework's resilience against malicious clients executing backdoor attacks (such as Doorping) and demonstrate robustness under the assumption of a sufficient number of participating clients. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SFDD and that the proposed defense concretely mitigates the identified vulnerabilities, with minimal impact on the performance of the distilled dataset. By addressing the interplay between privacy and federation in dataset distillation, this work advances the field of privacy-preserving Machine Learning making our SFDD framework a viable solution for sensitive data-sharing applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Arazzi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Cihangiroglu","given":"Mert"},{"family":"Nicolazzo","given":"Serena"},{"family":"Nocera","given":"Antonino"}],"citation-key":"arazziSecureFederatedData2025","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2502.13728","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,6]]},"number":"arXiv:2502.13728","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Secure Federated Data Distillation","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13728"},

Then, we perform a comprehensive experimental study to evaluate the performance of various clustering algorithms in different scenarios.

  {"id":"garciaMemeticAlgorithmEvolutionary2008","abstract":"Prototype selection problem consists of reducing the size of databases by removing samples that are considered noisy or not influential on nearest neighbour classification tasks. Evolutionary algorithms have been used recently for prototype selection showing good results. However, due to the complexity of this problem when the size of the databases increases, the behaviour of evolutionary algorithms could deteriorate considerably because of a lack of convergence. This additional problem is known as the scaling up problem. Memetic algorithms are approaches for heuristic searches in optimization problems that combine a population-based algorithm with a local search. In this paper, we propose a model of memetic algorithm that incorporates an ad hoc local search specifically designed for optimizing the properties of prototype selection problem with the aim of tackling the scaling up problem. In order to check its performance, we have carried out an empirical study including a comparison between our proposal and previous evolutionary and non-evolutionary approaches studied in the literature. The results have been contrasted with the use of non-parametric statistical procedures and show that our approach outperforms previously studied methods, especially when the database scales up.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"García","given":"Salvador"},{"family":"Cano","given":"José Ramón"},{"family":"Herrera","given":"Francisco"}],"citation-key":"garciaMemeticAlgorithmEvolutionary2008","container-title":"Pattern Recognition","container-title-short":"Pattern Recognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.patcog.2008.02.006","ISSN":"0031-3203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",8,1]]},"page":"2693-2709","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A memetic algorithm for evolutionary prototype selection: A scaling up approach","title-short":"A memetic algorithm for evolutionary prototype selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320308000770","volume":"41"},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse.

  {"id":"leiComprehensiveSurveyDataset2024","abstract":"Deep learning technology has developed unprecedentedly in the last decade and has become the primary choice in many application domains. This progress is mainly attributed to a systematic collaboration in which rapidly growing computing resources encourage advanced algorithms to deal with massive data. However, it has gradually become challenging to handle the unlimited growth of data with limited computing power. To this end, diverse approaches are proposed to improve data processing efficiency. Dataset distillation, a dataset reduction method, addresses this problem by synthesizing a small typical dataset from substantial data and has attracted much attention from the deep learning community. Existing dataset distillation methods can be taxonomized into meta-learning and data matching frameworks according to whether they explicitly mimic the performance of target data. Although dataset distillation has shown surprising performance in compressing datasets, there are still several limitations such as distilling high-resolution data or data with complex label spaces. This paper provides a holistic understanding of dataset distillation from multiple aspects, including distillation frameworks and algorithms, factorized dataset distillation, performance comparison, and applications.

Nowadays, high dimensional optimization problems are an interesting field of research. The high dimensionality introduces new problems for the optimization process, requiring more scalable algorithms that, at the same time, could explore better the higher domain space around each solution. In this work, we proposed a memetic algorithm, MA-SW-Chains, for large scale global optimization. This algorithm assigns to each individual a local search intensity that depends on its features, by chaining different local search applications. MA-SW-Chains is an adaptation to large scale optimization of a previous algorithm, MA-CMA-Chains, to improve its performance on high-dimensional problems.

  {"id":"pattersonCarbonEmissionsLarge2021","abstract":"The computation demand for machine learning (ML) has grown rapidly recently, which comes with a number of costs. Estimating the energy cost helps measure its environmental impact and finding greener strategies, yet it is challenging without detailed information. We calculate the energy use and carbon footprint of several recent large models-T5, Meena, GShard, Switch Transformer, and GPT-3-and refine earlier estimates for the neural architecture search that found Evolved Transformer. We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume <1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary ~5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are trained. Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can be ~1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented accelerators inside them can be ~2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce the carbon footprint up to ~100-1000X. These large factors also make retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce the carbon footprint of ML, we believe energy usage and CO2e should be a key metric in evaluating models, and we are collaborating with MLPerf developers to include energy usage during training and inference in this industry standard benchmark.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Patterson","given":"David"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Le","given":"Quoc"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Munguia","given":"Lluis-Miquel"},{"family":"Rothchild","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"So","given":"David"},{"family":"Texier","given":"Maud"},{"family":"Dean","given":"Jeff"}],"citation-key":"pattersonCarbonEmissionsLarge2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2104.10350","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,23]]},"number":"arXiv:2104.10350","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Carbon Emissions and Large Neural Network Training","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10350"},

Although evolutionary algorithms have been repeatedly applied to neural network topologies, the image classifiers thus discovered have remained inferior to human-crafted ones. Here, we evolve an image classifier---AmoebaNet-A---that surpasses hand-designs for the first time. To do this, we modify the tournament selection evolutionary algorithm by introducing an age property to favor the younger genotypes. Matching size, AmoebaNet-A has comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art ImageNet models discovered with more complex architecture-search methods. Scaled to larger size, AmoebaNet-A sets a new state-of-the-art 83.9% / 96.6% top-5 ImageNet accuracy. In a controlled comparison against a well known reinforcement learning algorithm, we give evidence that evolution can obtain results faster with the same hardware, especially at the earlier stages of the search. This is relevant when fewer compute resources are available. Evolution is, thus, a simple method to effectively discover high-quality architectures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Real","given":"Esteban"},{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Alok"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yanping"},{"family":"Le","given":"Quoc V."}],"citation-key":"realRegularizedEvolutionImage2019","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1802.01548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,16]]},"number":"arXiv:1802.01548","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01548"},

However, well-annotated datasets can be time-consuming and expensive to collect, lending increased interest to larger but noisy datasets that are more easily obtained. In this paper, we show that deep neural networks are capable of generalizing from training data for which true labels are massively outnumbered by incorrect labels. We demonstrate remarkably high test performance after training on corrupted data from MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. For example, on MNIST we obtain test accuracy above 90 percent even after each clean training example has been diluted with 100 randomly-labeled examples. Such behavior holds across multiple patterns of label noise, even when erroneous labels are biased towards confusing classes. We show that training in this regime requires a significant but manageable increase in dataset size that is related to the factor by which correct labels have been diluted. Finally, we provide an analysis of our results that shows how increasing noise decreases the effective batch size.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Rolnick","given":"David"},{"family":"Veit","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Belongie","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Shavit","given":"Nir"}],"citation-key":"rolnickDeepLearningRobust2018","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1705.10694","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,26]]},"number":"arXiv:1705.10694","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Deep Learning is Robust to Massive Label Noise","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10694"},

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis.

However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation.

Many recently proposed approaches try to counter this by aligning the model to the new distribution prior to inference. With no labels available this requires unsupervised objectives to adapt the model on the observed test data. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Self-Training (TeST): a technique that takes as input a model trained on some source data and a novel data distribution at test time, and learns invariant and robust representations using a student-teacher framework. We find that models adapted using TeST significantly improve over baseline test-time adaptation algorithms. TeST achieves competitive performance to modern domain adaptation algorithms, while having access to 5-10x less data at time of adaption. We thoroughly evaluate a variety of baselines on two tasks: object detection and image segmentation and find that models adapted with TeST.

However, these improvements through scaling alone require considerable costs in compute and energy. Here we focus on the scaling of error with dataset size and show how in theory we can break beyond power law scaling and potentially even reduce it to exponential scaling instead if we have access to a high-quality data pruning metric that ranks the order in which training examples should be discarded to achieve any pruned dataset size. We then test this improved scaling prediction with pruned dataset size empirically, and indeed observe better than power law scaling in practice on ResNets trained on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet. Next, given the importance of finding high-quality pruning metrics, we perform the first large-scale benchmarking study of ten different data pruning metrics on ImageNet. We find most existing high performing metrics scale poorly to ImageNet, while the best are computationally intensive and require labels for every image. We therefore developed a new simple, cheap and scalable self-supervised pruning metric that demonstrates comparable performance to the best supervised metrics. Overall, our work suggests that the discovery of good data-pruning metrics may provide a viable path forward to substantially improved neural scaling laws, thereby reducing the resource costs of modern deep learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Sorscher","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Geirhos","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Shekhar","given":"Shashank"},{"family":"Ganguli","given":"Surya"},{"family":"Morcos","given":"Ari S."}],"citation-key":"sorscherNeuralScalingLaws2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2206.14486","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,21]]},"number":"arXiv:2206.14486","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Beyond neural scaling laws: beating power law scaling via data pruning","title-short":"Beyond neural scaling laws","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14486"},

  {"id":"subburajFuzzySystemBased2025","abstract":"Simulated by nature’s evolution, numerous evolutionary algorithms had been proposed. These algorithms perform better for a particular problem domain and extensive parameter fine tuning and adaptations are required in optimizing problems of varied domain. This paper aims to develop robust and self-adaptive memetic algorithm by combining Differential Evolution based algorithm, a popular population based global search method with the Controlled Local search procedure to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Memetic Algorithm is an enhanced evolutionary algorithm, it combines global search method with local search techniques for faster convergence. Memetic algorithm improves both exploration and exploitation, preventing premature convergence and also refines the current best solutions efficiently. Proposed algorithm is named as Fuzzy based Memetic Algorithm using Diversity control (F-MAD). In F-MAD, population diversity is controlled through the control parameters self-adaptation of Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) such as, crossover rate and scaling factor by using two fuzzy systems. A controlled local search procedure is adapted for guiding convergence process thus balancing explore-exploit cycle. The control parameter self-adaptation and enhanced selection method with controlled local search method aid population diversity control in decision space and attaining optimal solutions with uniform distribution in terms of diversity and convergence metrics in objective space. These characteristics help the proposed method suitable to be extended to different application domain without the need of trial-and-error fine tuning of the parameters. The performance is tested through standard benchmark test problems-CEC 2009 test problems and DTLZ test problem and further validated through performance metrics and statistical test. It is compared with popular optimization algorithms and experiment results indicate that F-MAD perform well than State of-The-Art (SOTA) algorithms taken for comparison. F-MAD algorithm attains better results for 8 out of 10 CEC 2009 test problems (UF1-UF10) when compared to 20 other algorithms taken for comparison.

  {"id":"wangDatasetDistillation2020","abstract":"Model distillation aims to distill the knowledge of a complex model into a simpler one. In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation called dataset distillation: we keep the model fixed and instead attempt to distill the knowledge from a large training dataset into a small one. The idea is to synthesize a small number of data points that do not need to come from the correct data distribution, but will, when given to the learning algorithm as training data, approximate the model trained on the original data. For example, we show that it is possible to compress 60,000 MNIST training images into just 10 synthetic distilled images (one per class) and achieve close to original performance with only a few gradient descent steps, given a fixed network initialization. We evaluate our method in various initialization settings and with different learning objectives.

  {"id":"wangImprovedCertifiedDefenses2022","abstract":"Data poisoning attacks aim at manipulating model behaviors through distorting training data. Previously, an aggregation-based certified defense, Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA), was proposed to mitigate this threat. DPA predicts through an aggregation of base classifiers trained on disjoint subsets of data, thus restricting its sensitivity to dataset distortions. In this work, we propose an improved certified defense against general poisoning attacks, namely Finite Aggregation. In contrast to DPA, which directly splits the training set into disjoint subsets, our method first splits the training set into smaller disjoint subsets and then combines duplicates of them to build larger (but not disjoint) subsets for training base classifiers. This reduces the worst-case impacts of poison samples and thus improves certified robustness bounds. In addition, we offer an alternative view of our method, bridging the designs of deterministic and stochastic aggregation-based certified defenses. Empirically, our proposed Finite Aggregation consistently improves certificates on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB, boosting certified fractions by up to 3.05%, 3.87% and 4.77%, respectively, while keeping the same clean accuracies as DPA's, effectively establishing a new state of the art in (pointwise) certified robustness against data poisoning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenxiao"},{"family":"Levine","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Feizi","given":"Soheil"}],"citation-key":"wangImprovedCertifiedDefenses2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2202.02628","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,14]]},"number":"arXiv:2202.02628","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Improved Certified Defenses against Data Poisoning with (Deterministic) Finite Aggregation","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02628"},

Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Medical Imaging Meta-Dataset (MedIMeta), a novel multi-domain, multi-task meta-dataset. MedIMeta contains 19 medical imaging datasets spanning 10 different domains and encompassing 54 distinct medical tasks, all of which are standardized to the same format and readily usable in PyTorch or other ML frameworks.

A vital enabler of its great success is the availability of abundant and high-quality data for building machine learning models. Recently, the role of data in AI has been significantly magnified, giving rise to the emerging concept of data-centric AI. The attention of researchers and practitioners has gradually shifted from advancing model design to enhancing the quality and quantity of the data. In this survey, we discuss the necessity of data-centric AI, followed by a holistic view of three general data-centric goals (training data development, inference data development, and data maintenance) and the representative methods. We also organize the existing literature from automation and collaboration perspectives, discuss the challenges, and tabulate the benchmarks for various tasks. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey that provides a global view of a spectrum of tasks across various stages of the data lifecycle.

This paper proposes a training set synthesis technique for data-efficient learning, called Dataset Condensation, that learns to condense large dataset into a small set of informative synthetic samples for training deep neural networks from scratch. We formulate this goal as a gradient matching problem between the gradients of deep neural network weights that are trained on the original and our synthetic data. We rigorously evaluate its performance in several computer vision benchmarks and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Finally we explore the use of our method in continual learning and neural architecture search and report promising gains when limited memory and computations are available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Mopuri","given":"Konda Reddy"},{"family":"Bilen","given":"Hakan"}],"citation-key":"zhaoDatasetCondensationGradient2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2006.05929","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,8]]},"number":"arXiv:2006.05929","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Dataset Condensation with Gradient Matching","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05929"},

The CNN has superior features for autonomous learning and expression, and feature extraction from original input data can be realized by means of training CNN models that match practical applications. Due to the rapid progress in deep learning technology, the structure of CNN is becoming more and more complex and diverse. Consequently, it gradually replaces the traditional machine learning methods. This paper presents an elementary understanding of CNN components and their functions, including input layers, convolution layers, pooling layers, activation functions, batch normalization, dropout, fully connected layers, and output layers. On this basis, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of the past and current research status of the applications of CNN models in computer vision fields, e.g., image classification, object detection, and video prediction. In addition, we summarize the challenges and solutions of the deep CNN, and future research directions are also discussed.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xia"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Limin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yufei"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xuming"},{"family":"Deveci","given":"Muhammet"},{"family":"Parmar","given":"Milan"}],"citation-key":"zhaoReviewConvolutionalNeural2024","container-title":"Artificial Intelligence Review","container-title-short":"Artif Intell Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s10462-024-10721-6","ISSN":"1573-7462","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,23]]},"language":"en","page":"99","source":"Springer Link","title":"A review of convolutional neural networks in computer vision","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-024-10721-6","volume":"57"},
  {"id":"zhouDistilledOneShotFederated2021","abstract":"Current federated learning algorithms take tens of communication rounds transmitting unwieldy model weights under ideal circumstances and hundreds when data is poorly distributed. Inspired by recent work on dataset distillation and distributed one-shot learning, we propose Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning (DOSFL) to significantly reduce the communication cost while achieving comparable performance. In just one round, each client distills their private dataset, sends the synthetic data (e.g. images or sentences) to the server, and collectively trains a global model. The distilled data look like noise and are only useful to the specific model weights, i.e., become useless after the model updates. With this weight-less and gradient-less design, the total communication cost of DOSFL is up to three orders of magnitude less than FedAvg while preserving between 93% to 99% performance of a centralized counterpart. Afterwards, clients could switch to traditional methods such as FedAvg to finetune the last few percent to fit personalized local models with local datasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we show the accuracy and communication performance of DOSFL on both vision and language tasks with different models including CNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc. We demonstrate that an eavesdropping attacker cannot properly train a good model using the leaked distilled data, without knowing the initial model weights. DOSFL serves as an inexpensive method to quickly converge on a performant pre-trained model with less than 0.1% communication cost of traditional methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yanlin"},{"family":"Pu","given":"George"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Xiyao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaolin"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Dapeng"}],"citation-key":"zhouDistilledOneShotFederated2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2009.07999","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,6]]},"number":"arXiv:2009.07999","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07999"}
